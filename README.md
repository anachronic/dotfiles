# dotfiles

Good ol' dotfiles.

## Things that need to be done

* Add battery/bluetooth support for laptops
* Move to zsh from bash
* Solve the search engine problem (chromium ext, surfraw, something...)
* Add custom pkgbuild for caps2esc
* **MAIL**
* RSS reader
* Automate install
* tmux

## OS

These dotfiles should work pretty well with Arch Linux provided you install some
deps (I might be missing some): `zathura, nodejs, npm, rxvt-unicode,
urxvt-perls, zsh, ranger, neovim, feh`.

Keyboard layout is US with altgr-intl option.

## WM

`i3wm` with `i3-gaps`. Bar on top is `polybar`, network is ran by
`NetworkManager`.

## Neovim

I'm using neovim this time. More on this later

## Ranger

Ranger should work pretty well with `neovim`, `zathura` and `feh`.

## Music

`spotify`(AUR) with `playerctl`.
